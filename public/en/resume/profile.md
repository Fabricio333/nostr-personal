Finance student passionate about economics and business. One of my strengths is my curiosity, which has allowed me to learn and understand various topics over the past few years, from hardware development to programming trading bots, data analysis, and cybersecurity tool development. This enables me to find holistic and creative solutions to any problem that arises. I enjoy continuous learning and working towards long-term goals that create a societal impact.
