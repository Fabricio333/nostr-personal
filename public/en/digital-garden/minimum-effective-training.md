Short, consistent, high-impact physical routines, are excellent for people that 

1. Don't have too much time to work out 
2. People with self motivation that don't last too much

A simple routine like [WebWorkout Routine](https://fabri.lat/projects/webworkouttimer)  with 15m of activity, can be incredible cost-effective to gain muscle and feel good.
