The [[fiat-system]] not only devalues money. It also fragments attention with short-term incentives. 
Specially in the places with really unstable currencies e.g Latin America we easily see how we pursue instant gratification in many forms, such as drugs, junk food, sedentarism, scrolling, etc, this is caused by the broken incentives to think long term and to save our [[time-and-money]]
