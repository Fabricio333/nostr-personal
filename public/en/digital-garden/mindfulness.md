Mindfulness is the practice of being focused in few or one external or internal stimuli, for example, sitting down and paying attention to breathing, counting breathing, paying attention to our legs, to our hands or our body, also fixing our sight on a something with our eyes open or not, but without rushing in random thoughts, letting them go.
