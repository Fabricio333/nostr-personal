A digital garden is a digital [[second-brain]] which is a personal space where we can leave notes in a organized that does not necessarily mean a perfectly ordered library but a dynamic and growing set of notes, writings, thoughts that are interconnected to each other.

Current most used tools to do this are:
- Notion
- Obsidian.md
