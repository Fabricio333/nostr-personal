## Features
- Browser-based, offline-capable password manager using BIP39 seed phrases and SHA-256 for deterministic password generation.
- Optional encrypted cloud backups via the Nostr protocol using nip04, kind:1 events, and key derivation from the seed phrase.
- Local session encryption with password-based AES protection stored in localStorage.
- Privacy-focused and portable: works entirely offline, mobile-friendly, and avoids central storage or server reliance.
